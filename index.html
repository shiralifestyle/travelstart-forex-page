            <p>Ideal for travellers who’d prefer to stick to what they know, using your credit or debit card is a popular and handy option when travelling abroad. Major credit card brands, like MasterCard and Visa, are globally accepted. You can use debit and credit cards over the counter and at designated ATMs (depending on your location).</p>
            <p class="content-container-second-text">Make sure to tell your bank when you are travelling overseas. If they see unusual activities on your account, they may freeze it, which can be quite a hassle to reverse when you're abroad!</p>

            <p>Travelling with cash is a convenient option, but also poses a great risk should you lose your wallet, or get pickpocketed. Having cash comes in handy if you’re travelling somewhere where other payment methods aren’t an option and if you’re spending a lot of time outside of a major city. If you decide to travel with a large amount of cash, consider splitting it up and storing it in different places (wallet, travel pouch, waterproof bag, etc.), so that should you get robbed, you won’t lose all your cash in one go. If you need to exchange your money, find a bureau that offers a flat rate, and try to exchange large amounts at a time to avoid paying multiple fees. </p>
            <p class="content-container-second-text">Cash is always handy to have, especially if you arrive at your destination late and need to pay for a local taxi to your hotel. Some countries charge an airport departure tax that must be paid in cash when you check in for your return flight. Some of these countries include: <a href="https://www.travelstart.co.za/lp/costa-rica/flights">Costa Rica</a>, <a href="https://www.travelstart.co.za/lp/egypt/flights">Egypt</a>, <a href="https://www.travelstart.co.za/lp/guyana/flights">Guyana</a>, <a href="https://www.travelstart.co.za/lp/indonesia/flights">Indonesia</a>,<a href="https://www.travelstart.co.za/lp/panama/flights">Panama</a> and the <a href="https://www.travelstart.co.za/lp/philippines/flights">Philippines</a>.</p>

          <div class="content-container-text">
            <p>Cash passports, or travel wallets, have become a much more popular way of travelling. These are great if you’re visiting more than one country and need multiple currencies. The cash passport is essentially a debit card that is pre-loaded with your specified amount of foreign currency. You can use this card to withdraw cash at ATM outlets and swipe at shops and restaurants. Although these cards can be obtained from your local bank, they are not linked to your bank account, which means you save on bank fees. You can load the card with multiple currencies and top up your balance online. If the card gets lost or stolen, you can alert your bank or forex outlet to block the card and send you a new one.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Foreign exchange can be ordered up to 60 days before your departure date.
            <li>Avoid changing money at airports and side street kiosks, as the commission fees are usually a lot higher.</li>
            <li>South African residents over 18 years are allowed to legally take up to R1,000,000 of foreign currency abroad per year in the form of travel allowance.</li>
            <li>If you do not exchange excess foreign currency within 30 days of returning from your trip, you may be liable to penalties from the Reserve Bank.</li>
            <li>Travellers embarking on a business trip within 90 days of the previous trip may retain their excess foreign currency for use on their upcoming trip.</li> 
            <li>Foreign currency can only be transferred to your own bank account or that of your spouse. Minors travelling with their parent(s) can transfer their allowance into their parent’s bank account.</li> 
            <li>You do not need to produce proof of transport if travelling to Namibia, Swaziland or Lesotho.</li>
